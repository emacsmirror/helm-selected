#+TITLE: A helm extension for selected.el

* Introduction

That packages is a =helm= extension for =selected.el=. =selected.el= provides a combined keymap with associated commands for the selected region like a popup menu when you right-click on a selected word in your document. The menu, however, will not be displayed in an emacs buffer. So this package provides a visible menu with command candidates by supporting of =helm= interface.

* Recommended setting

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load "selected"
  (when (require 'helm-selected nil t)
    (define-key selected-keymap (kbd "h") 'helm-selected)))
#+END_SRC

After you select a region in your emacs buffer, just type =h=, then a command menu will be popping up.
